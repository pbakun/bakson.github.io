My name is Piotr Bakun and I am a software developer both by career and passion, but let's start from the beginning...
#### Background
I graduated Control Engineering in Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. During my Masters I already started to work as an engineer for Smart Housing, changing behavior of client's houses (lighting, shutters) depending on the weather or whatever else they wanted. Later on I worked on some bigger projects, like Building Automation System for warehouse and its offices. After two years I started seeking for a change and thought that working in more industrial area would suits me better. After all, that is what I thought a Control Engineer would do. I found a job at Poland's biggest IT company, which also had an engineering department and started to work on mainly on car's engine assembly machines. The job was great, but also required a lot of trips. That gets you tired and burned out really fast, specially if you have someone to go back to. After almost 2 years I&nbsp;decided to move on and start my software development career.
#### The journey begins
I already had some background from University, where I had 2 semesters of C. Also my previous jobs were kind of coding, not always in the same way as a regular programmer understands it, but still. For me the choice was always between C# and Java, as I saw them as a "real" programming languages. Thought that I would put my bet on C# and started learning it. I must say that lonely evening in hotel on business trip helped me a lot. Without them I'm not sure I would find enough motivation to learn C# on a level, that could get me a first developer job.
#### First project
Till this day I believe one can learn the most from real live projects. Hundred tutorials are not equal one project. My first was an ASP.NET Core app that would support first contact doctor and change queue numbers, so patient enters the room only when sees given number. I used SignalR to get instant notification on screen placed outside on the corridor. Screens were to be placed above room's door and were connected to Raspberry PI, which had a chromium browser opened with queue view.
#### First job
I've managed to quickly find my first job, although it was not what I initially expected. Instead of continue my learning of C# I had to quickly get my hands on ReactJS with purely frontend project. Although it wasn't path that I chose, I do not regret. Thanks to that experience I could learn a bit more frontend and move forward from just changing backgrounds and creating ugly forms in HTML. After 8 months I decided it is time to move on and started searching for new opportunities.
#### Current day
At the end of 2020 I got a new position, as .NET developer in a swedish agency. Here I could get familiar with one of most popular enterprise .NET-based CMS - Sitecore.
