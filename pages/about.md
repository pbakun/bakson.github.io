My name is Piotr Bakun and I am a software developer both by career and passion, but let's start from the beginning...
#### Early beginnings
I graduated Control Engineering in Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. During my Masters I already started to work as an engineer for Smart Housing, changing behavior of client's houses (lighting, shutters) depending on the weather or whatever else they wanted. Later on I worked on some bigger projects, like Building Automation System for warehouse and its offices. After two years I started seeking for a change and thought that working in more industrial area would suits me better. After all, that is what I thought a Control Engineer would do. I found a job at Poland's biggest IT company, which also had an engineering department and started to work on mainly on car's engine assembly machines.
