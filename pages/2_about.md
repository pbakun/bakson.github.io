My name is Piotr Bakun and I am software developer.

Before I came into the world of IT I was working as Control Engineer, both in building and industrial automation, eg. smart housing or car engine assembly machines. Later I evolved into .NET developer. My main interests are web and cloud development followed by utilizing DevOps technics. Although I have my main interest in software world I don't run from making things look good, therefore I am also familiar with latest NodeJS based frontend frameworks like React and Vue. Currently I hold a Lead Developer position at swedish digital agency. I work mainly with Sitecore CMS and Azure. I hate repetable manual work, thus I love automating various tasks.

Currently I live in Austria with my lovely wife, where we explore beautiful mountain landscapes and enjoy skiing in the winter. Basically work from vacation!
